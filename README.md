## Background

After the 2020 wildfire season, when we were facing a possible Level 3 evacuation due to a fire rapidly spreading just south of us, I found myself paying a bit more attention to where wildfires were at a given time. That was one reason for making this app. A couple more were to get comfortable pulling from an api, as well as using React. Both are present in this application.

## Features

- Uses [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) library for rendering map and allowing for GPS interaction
- Uses components from [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- Uses `fetch` api and arcgis public API to pull data for current wildfires
- Built with React

(Note: This is still a work in progress.)
